***

### Defend what is yours! 

***

### You can expand available agent space!

***

### You can change an agent's role through the ASSIGN ROLE Menu (top-right), there is a maximum number of agents per type.

***

### You can send scavengers to explore. You can only make them return once they have reached their destination. Scavengers accumulate food and money while scavenging, choose wisely when to make them come back.
