## Understanding Chase The Cure

***

### Check how far, or close, are you from winning/losing through the Cure/Panic progress bars

***

### Watch over how many food you have left, agents will die from starvation if it gets down to 0!

***

### Defend what is yours! 

***

### You can expand available agent space!

***

### You can change an agent's role through the ASSIGN ROLE Menu (top-right), there is a maximum number of agents per type.

***

### You can send scavengers to explore. You can only make them return once they have reached their destination. Scavengers accumulate food and money while scavenging, choose wisely when to make them come back.

### Newcomers are sent in every 30 seconds, you can either discard them or assign them to a role. Check their attributes to see where they fit the best. Are they super intelligent? Make them scientists!
